Whenever I work on a mono repo, sometimes understanding everything can be either too time consuming or just annoying if the code hasn't been maintained properly. 

You also don't have to work on every aspect of the mono repo everytime you get assigned a task or whatever, so this just quickly provides me context on what some of the code does.

You just input the directory relative to where you ran the script and you should be able to generate a text file that has all the code outputed to it. 

Info dump it on any LLM of your choosing.

Don't forget to change the prompt if you do not like it! I just happen to get better results with this prompt than previous ones I have used.
